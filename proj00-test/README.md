# Test: Student Information Formatting

**Programming B â€“ Academic Year 2023-2024**  
**Department**: Computer Engineering and Computer Science, Cesena  

## Overview  

This project demonstrates how to declare and initialize variables to store a student's personal information and print it in a formatted manner using C.  

The program defines variables for the student's first name, last name, and student ID number, then uses the `printf()` function to display the information in a structured and readable format.  

## Objectives  

1. **Variable Declaration and Initialization**  
   - Store the first name of the student as a string.  
   - Store the last name of the student as a string.  
   - Store the student ID number as an integer.  

2. **Formatted Output**  
   Use `printf()` to print the following details:  
   - **First Name**: Left-aligned with a fixed width of 10 characters.  
   - **Last Name**: Left-aligned with a fixed width of 10 characters.  
   - **Student ID**: Zero-padded to always display 10 digits.
